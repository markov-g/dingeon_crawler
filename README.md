# dungeon_crawler

### Short Description
A dungeon crawler game written in Rust with procedurally-generated levels, monsters of increasing difficulty, and turn-based movement.


### Story 
The hero’s hometown is suffering from a plague of monsters. Welling up from the depths, they seem unstoppable. Legend tells of the Amulet of Yala—Yet Another Lost Amulet—that can be used to stem the tide. After a long night at the tavern, the hero promises to save the day and sets forth into the dungeon

### Basic Game Loops
The game loop for the dungeon crawler looks like this:

1. Enter dungeon level.
2. Explore, gradually revealing the map.
3. Encounter enemies that the player fights or flees from.
4. Find power-ups and use them to strengthen the player.
5. Locate the exit to the level (go to one).
